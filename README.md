This was a group project done for [STA304](https://utm.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/sta304h5).

We were interested in how a students happiness relates to the time they spend on hobbies and studies.

Though there is no way to objectively measure how happy someone is, we decided to ask students to rate their happiness from 1 to 10.

You can view our full questionnaire in this repository. Among other things, we asked the students how much time they spend per week on their hobbies and studies.

We used Simple Random Sampling to conduct our survey. Due to time constraints we were only able to sample 30 students. Our bound of error for one of our hypotheses was 0.175.

To test whether the students self-rated happiness correlates with the time they spend on their hobbies or the time they spend on studies, we used the Kendall Rank Correlation Test; a correlation test designed for ordinal data (like rating Happiness from 1 to 10).

We wrote both a Technical Report and a Written Report. The Technical Report was written for someone with a statistical background similar to our own (an undergraduate Statistics Student), while the Written Report was designed for a more general audience.

The R code we wrote for both reports is shown at the end.
